# Linux mouse record
A *simple* app to record and replay mouse *clicks* on linux.

# Using
```
pipx install linux-mouse-record
linux-mouse-record  > recording.jsonl
linux-mouse-replay < recording.jsonl
```

The recording file is a stream of JSON lines and can be editted by hands.

# Motivation
I wanted to record a click and replay it. I found a lot of apps, but a lot of them were complicated-to-use GUIs, two didn't work, and a bunch weren't really documented.

This tool will probably never support additional features you want - unless I need them.

# Alternatives and prior work
This is mostly a wrapper about `pynput`. There are a variety of tools that do this - but I could not find a nice CLI that worked for linux and worked - though perhaps one exists.
